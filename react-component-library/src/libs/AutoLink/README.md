Renders a string as plaintext, with URLs converted to appropriate <a> elements.

```
Use String.prototype.split() and String.prototype.match() with a regular expression 
to find URLs in a string. Return a <React.Fragment> with matched URLs rendered as <a> elements, 
dealing with missing protocol prefixes if necessary, and the rest of the string rendered as 
plaintext.
 ```
