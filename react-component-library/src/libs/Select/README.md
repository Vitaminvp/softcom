```
Renders a <select> element that uses a callback function to pass its value to the parent component.

Use object destructuring to set defaults for certain attributes of the <select> element. 
Render a <select> element with the appropriate attributes and use the callback function in 
the onChange event to pass the value of the textarea to the parent. Use destructuring on the 
values array to pass an array of value and text elements and the selected attribute to define 
the initial value of the <select> element.
